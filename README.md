# Overview

The Paracosm has been released upon your world, a new dark dimension **endlessly spreading**, filled with
wonderous weapons, items and blocks to expand the core experience of Minecraft in a way never before seen.
Paracosm challenges you with new, innovative mechanics, bosses and a progression system that encourages
creativity in building and reasoning.

**Some of Paracosm's many features include:**

- A whole new dimension and set of biomes to explore
- More ores, materials and items.
- New weapons and armor in a class based system. (Melee, Ranged, ...)
- An innovative boss-based progression system.
- Various server management utilities.
- YouTube / Twitch utilities built in for content creators.
- An original soundtrack.
- An API for addon creators to latch onto.
- Nostalgia mode.

**[Addons](#addons) can be easily found and added from our curated addon repository or
from the CurseForge community.**

# Installation

**The following versions are officially supported:** 

- Forge 1.15
- Forge 1.14
- Forge 1.12

To install the mod, simply use the [installer](pee poo poo) available for download
 from us, assuming you have Minecraft Forge installed already. Additionally, the mod
 can be installed from the Twitch client if desired.
 
**PLEASE NOTE: This is a Forge mod, and as such it is not and will not be available 
on Fabric for the foreseeable future.**

# Addons

Paracosm was designed with modularity in mind, allowing the community to load and use addons 
of your choice, and install 3rd party addons directly from either our addon repository or from Curse.
 A few examples are:

- WIP (Does not exist ;-;)

Feel free to take a [peek](https://cogboard.red/t/approved-repositories/210) at a list of
available 3rd party addons to Paracosm.

# API

API [guides and documentation](peee) are available here.

# Contributions

**Paracosm** is in continuous development by a loving team, dedicated to the craft (no pun intended).
While it is preferable for members of the community to create addons instead of directly contributing to
the source of Paracosm, for the sake of an experience designed around Dewdrop Studios' vision of what it should
be, we do not accept pull requests that alter the experience (most assets), though we do accept bug fixes and additions to
 the API, which are greatly appreciated.

To set up the workspace:

- Clone the repository.
- Run the setup script for your OS from the /scripts directory. (.sh for Linux / macOS, .bat for Windows).
- Import into your IDE of choice (Eclipse / IntelliJ).
